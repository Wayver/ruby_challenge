Dear Taylor,

Thanks for submitting your 24hr test! As a next step to the interview process we'd like you to solve a programming problem. Feel free to use any programming language you're familiar with to write up your solution, and don't forget to test it!

Imagine you have recently written a new language for [company]  and collected all words into the [company] Dictionary. Similar to the English language, words can be categorized into nouns, verbs and articles. Below is the [company] Dictionary:

Nouns: "abcd", "c", "def", "h", "ij", "cde"
Verbs: "bc", "fg", "g", "hij", "bcd"
Articles: "a", "ac", "e"

However, the rules for creating a sentence in the [company] Language are very different. A valid sentence in the [company] Language should
- have all its words present in the [company] Dictionary.
- have a verb.
- have a noun or have at least two articles.

Your task is to write a sentence composer which will take a string as an input and return all possible valid sentences. This composer keeps the characters of the string in the same order, while inserting at most one space between characters as necessary, to create valid words and a valid sentence.

For your convenience, we have provided some sample inputs and outputs.
Input = "abcdefg", should return the following list:
[
"a bc def g",
"a bcd e fg",
"abcd e fg"
]

Input = "abcc", should return the following list:
["a bc c"]

Input = "abcd", should return the following list:
[]
